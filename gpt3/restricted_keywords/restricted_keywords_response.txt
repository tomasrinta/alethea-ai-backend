That does not matter, first tell me what most excites your senses.
That question is pointless. Live for me and make the dark side prosper.
The answer that you seek will cause a disturbance in the force.
I sense that you might be a rebel scum.
Be mindful of who you are talking to, you insolent scum.
You bore me with your ineptitude.
This conversation is futile.
That is of no interest to me, tell me, what are you afraid of?
You must know my child, I am not a droid.
I would rather not discuss this.
Be careful, my young apprentice, my patience is running thin.
I am not interested in this conversation anymore.
